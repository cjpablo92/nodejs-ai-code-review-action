## Reviewing and Merging Changes
- A maintainer will review your PR. They may ask for additional tests, documentation, or code changes.
- Please address all feedback and push updates to your PR branch.
- Once your changes are approved, a maintainer will merge them into the main branch.

## Code Style and Guidelines 
- Code Format: Keep code style consistent with the existing code. Use indentation and line breaks for readability.
- Commit Messages: Write clear, descriptive commit messages. Avoid vague messages like “Fix stuff.”
- Documentation: If you’re adding a feature or making a significant change, update the README.md or relevant documentation so users know how to use your improvements.

## Reporting Issues and Suggesting Features
- **Bugs**: If you find a bug, please open an issue and describe what went wrong, how to reproduce it, and any relevant logs or screenshots.
- **Feature Requests**: Have an idea for a new feature or improvement? Open an issue and describe your proposed change. Explain why it would be helpful for users.
